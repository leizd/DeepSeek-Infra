# Pre-4.0 Quality Baseline

This document tracks where the project stands after the 3.5.0 optional Gateway request-preparation update, built on the 3.3.2 95% coverage milestone and 3.4.0 semantic-cache vector ranking. The stable development line remains 3.x; the published `v4.0.0-rc.1` is an architecture preview and release-flow rehearsal.

> **Purpose**: know and enforce the gap. The [4.0 RC readiness matrix](4_0_RC_READINESS.md) records the already-published `v4.0.0-rc.1` rehearsal; it does not make 4.0.0 the active stable line or imply a near-term stable 4.0.0 release.

---

## Current quality milestone: 3.5.0

At the end of 3.5.0:

- All Rust components remain **default-disabled**.
- The hybrid runtime has a complete operational runbook ([RUST_HYBRID_RUNTIME_RUNBOOK.md](RUST_HYBRID_RUNTIME_RUNBOOK.md)) and a release-readiness checklist ([RELEASE_READINESS_3_1_X.md](RELEASE_READINESS_3_1_X.md)).
- Python CI gates pass at the inherited 95% coverage gate after two 3.3.2 full-suite statement-and-branch runs measured 95.3428% and 95.3396%.
- Rust CI gates pass (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test`).
- Offline eval gates pass with `--strict`.
- The Rust sidecar has a standalone multi-stage Docker image, optional Compose file, container health check, and offline smoke test.
- A test-only Compose overlay starts Python, Rust, and an offline upstream stub, verifies Rust request preparation through the real Python Gateway path, then stops the sidecar and proves the same request succeeds through Python fallback.
- Rust Policy decisions carry stable codes, decision and trace identifiers, capability/risk context, and structured redacted audit fields.
- Policy backend failures have explicit `fallback`, `deny`, and `error` behavior; all deny/error paths stop tool execution.
- A shared 38-case fixture proves Python/Rust parity for normalization, full Top-K ordering, tie-breaks, scores, citations, and index validation.
- The independent `rag-parity` CI job runs against a live Rust sidecar and uploads a machine-readable difference report.
- The independent `gateway-request-parity` CI job runs 68 deterministic valid/invalid cases against a live sidecar and uploads a machine-readable report.
- A machine-readable RC requirements manifest classifies quality blockers, architecture decision blockers, and non-blocking recommendations with explicit owners and evidence.
- [ADR-0040](adr/ADR-0040-hybrid-runtime-architecture.md) approves a Python-first hybrid 4.0 architecture: no Rust delegate is default-on, default deployment remains Python-only, and Python fallback is guaranteed throughout 4.x.
- Gateway streaming, model listing, provider routing, upstream HTTP, credentials, retries, and real MCP tool execution remain Python-owned by design; Rust Gateway owns only deterministic request preparation, while Rust MCP owns JSON-RPC validation/routing.
- The machine-readable architecture contract resolves all five architecture blockers from real decision fields, including the intentionally empty Rust default-on set.
- Normal PRs and `main` generate the RC report without permanent failure; `release/*` and `rc/*` branches run the same checker in strict mode.
- The default Docker deployment still builds and runs only the Python service.
- Semantic-cache vector ranking can use the existing opt-in Rust RAG delegate, with strict response validation, backend diagnostics, and Python fallback.
- Gateway request preparation can use the existing opt-in Rust Gateway delegate, with strict response validation, stable error codes, safe diagnostics, and Python fallback.
- The complete 3.5.0 statement-and-branch run measures **95.34%**, above the 95% CI gate and the 95.20% release minimum; coverage omissions are unchanged.

## Rust core status matrix

| Component | Rust crate | Sidecar routes | Python opt-in integration | Default-on in 3.1.x | Gap before 4.0.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gateway** | `deepseek-gateway` | `GET /healthz`, `POST /gateway/request/prepare` | `DEEPSEEK_RUST_GATEWAY=1` delegates deterministic preparation only | ❌ | Streaming, models, credentials, providers, upstream HTTP, retries, tools, and trace lifecycle remain Python-owned |
| **MCP** | `deepseek-mcp` | `POST /mcp` | `DEEPSEEK_RUST_MCP=1` delegates JSON-RPC handling | ❌ | No real Python tool execution bridge into Rust; default-on not decided |
| **Policy** | `deepseek-policy` | `POST /policy/url`, `/policy/path`, `/policy/capability` | `DEEPSEEK_RUST_POLICY=1` delegates structured, audited URL/path/capability checks | ❌ | Python Tool Policy remains the fallback; default enforcement not decided |
| **RAG** | `deepseek-rag` | `POST /rag/query/normalize`, `/rag/chunks/score`, `/rag/vectors/rank`, `/rag/citation/format`, `/rag/index/validate` | `DEEPSEEK_RUST_RAG=1` delegates hot paths and semantic-cache batch vector ranking | ❌ | Deterministic hot-path parity is proven; embedding and vector DB access still live in Python |

Legend:

- **MVP** ✅ = Rust crate exists and sidecar endpoints are implemented.
- **Opt-in integration** ✅ = Python app can delegate to Rust behind a feature flag with fallback.
- **Default-on** ❌ = Rust component is not enabled by default and cannot yet replace Python path unconditionally.

## Coverage status

### Python

| Metric | Current | 4.0.0 target | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage gate | **95%** | ~95% | Cleared |
| Measured coverage (full suite) | **95.34%** | ~95% | Cleared; above the 95.20% release minimum |

The gate was raised from 82% to 85% in 3.2.0, to 90% in 3.3.1, and to 95% in 3.3.2. The final uplift targets real failure behavior in DeepSeek streaming, RAG/files, launcher credentials, agent persistence/concurrency, Skills security/versioning, Browser/OCR/media, MCP, and workspace persistence. Coverage omit rules remain unchanged, and HIGH-risk coverage debt is lower than the 3.3.1 baseline.

### Rust

| Metric | Current | 4.0.0 target | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage gate | **Not set** | ~95% | **Unknown / not measured** |
| Measured coverage | Not measured | ~95% | Needs a coverage tool wired into `cargo test` and CI |

Rust coverage is currently not measured or gated. Before 4.0.0, the Rust workspace needs a coverage tool (e.g., `cargo-llvm-cov` or `tarpaulin`) and a CI gate.

---

## CI / release gate status

| Gate | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff check .` | ✅ Green | Minimal rule set by design. |
| `mypy .` | ✅ Green | `ignore_missing_imports=true`. |
| `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=95` | ✅ Green | The complete 3.5.0 run measured 95.34%; coverage omissions are unchanged. |
| `cargo fmt --check` | ✅ Green | Rust workspace. |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | ✅ Green | No warnings. |
| `cargo test --all` | ✅ Green | Rust crate tests. |
| Rust sidecar Docker build + smoke | ✅ CI gate | Independent job; does not alter the Python image. |
| Hybrid runtime E2E + fallback | ✅ CI gate | Gateway, MCP, Policy, and RAG over the live Compose network. |
| Rust/Python RAG parity | ✅ CI gate | 38 deterministic cases against a live Rust sidecar; JSON report uploaded. |
| Rust/Python Gateway request parity | ✅ CI gate | 68 deterministic cases against a live Rust sidecar; JSON report uploaded. |
| `node --check ...` | ✅ Green | Listed JS files. |
| `python scripts/check_doc_links.py` | ✅ Green | Internal doc links. |
| `pip-audit`, `bandit`, `detect-secrets` | ✅ Green | Security scan. |
| Offline eval suite `--strict` | ✅ Green | RAG, Tool, Injection, Agent, Security corpus. |
| `scripts/preflight_release.py --version 3.5.0 --ga` | Required | Release readiness. |

## Known gaps before 4.0.0

1. **Python coverage**: the 95% gate and measured RC target are cleared. Continue tracking risk-weighted debt so HIGH-risk gaps do not regress.
2. **Rust coverage**: Not measured or gated.
3. **Rust default-on**: ADR-0040 approves an empty default-on set for 4.0; future promotion requires a separate decision and matching evidence.
4. **Default packaging**: ADR-0040 approves Python-only default deployment; the Rust sidecar remains optional and separate from the default Python image and single-file exe build.
5. **Policy parity**: Stable Rust deny codes, trace correlation, redacted audits, and fail modes are proven; broader corpus-level Rust/Python rule parity is still required before default enforcement.
6. **RAG parity**: Deterministic normalization, scoring/order, citation, and validation parity is proven; embedding, vector database, and corpus-scale performance parity remain open.
7. **Gateway streaming**: Streaming chat completions remain Python-owned for 4.0 by ADR-0040; this is an explicit boundary, not a completed Rust path.
8. **Rust-side error contracts**: Policy decisions and Gateway request-preparation categories are stable contracts; broader MCP and RAG error-shape coverage remains open.

## Recommended 3.2.x milestones

These completed milestones keep the project on the conservative path toward 4.0.0 without turning readiness evidence into an early release declaration.

### 3.2.0 — Coverage uplift to 85% (completed)

- Achieved: raised the Python coverage gate from 82% to 85% with 85.559% measured coverage.
- Added failure and boundary coverage for Rust clients, Local RAG, tool execution/policy, web routes, core config, MCP, browser downloads, and launcher paths.
- Non-goals preserved: no runtime features, Rust default-on changes, Docker sidecar packaging, or 4.0.0 release candidate work.

### 3.2.1 — Rust sidecar Docker profile (completed)

- Added a multi-stage, non-root image containing only the Rust Gateway binary and health-check dependency.
- Added an independent Compose file, offline six-endpoint smoke test, static deployment contract tests, and a dedicated CI job.
- Preserved the default Python Compose deployment, default-disabled Rust flags, 85% Python coverage gate, and pre-4.0 status.

### 3.2.2 — End-to-end hybrid runtime smoke tests (completed)

- Added a test-only Compose overlay that starts Python and Rust on one container network with all four Rust flags enabled.
- Added an offline smoke that verifies Rust status, Gateway and MCP proxying, Tool Policy denial, and RAG normalization/ranking/citation through Python boundaries.
- Stops the Rust sidecar mid-run and verifies Gateway, MCP, Policy, and RAG fall back to Python without an application crash or unstructured 500.

### 3.2.3 — Policy deny / audit hardening (completed)

- **Completed in 3.2.3**: added stable deny codes, decision/trace identifiers, capability/risk context, and redacted structured audit logs.
- Added explicit `fallback`, `deny`, and `error` backend failure modes while preserving Python Policy as the default fallback.
- Proved with spies that Rust denial and backend fail-closed modes never invoke network, file-write, or execution helpers.
- Extended the live hybrid smoke to preserve the Rust decision code and identifier through the Python tool boundary.

### 3.2.4 — RAG parity tests against Python path (completed)

- Added 38 implementation-independent expected cases for query normalization, complete Top-K ordering/scores, citation formatting, and index validation.
- Added a strict live-sidecar parity runner with `1e-6` score tolerance, stable error categories, first-divergence output, and JSON report artifacts.
- Preserved CJK, mixed-language, punctuation, emoji, stable tie-break, and existing citation-format behavior.
- Kept embedding/vector retrieval and performance benchmarking outside this deterministic test-only milestone.

### 3.2.5 — 4.0 RC readiness checklist (completed)

- Added an owner-tagged, machine-readable blocker matrix and a human sign-off document without creating an RC.
- Added terminal and JSON reporting with an honest `NOT READY` decision while coverage and architecture blockers remain.
- Added report-only CI behavior for normal development and strict blocking behavior for `release/*` and `rc/*` branches.
- Preserved the 85% current coverage gate, 95% RC target, Python default runtime, opt-in Rust flags, and existing Docker defaults.

### 3.3.0 — 4.0 runtime architecture decision (completed)

- Approved ADR-0040 and a machine-readable Python-first hybrid runtime contract.
- Resolved all five architecture blockers without claiming Rust Gateway streaming or a real Rust-to-Python MCP tool bridge.
- Kept all Rust delegates opt-in, default Compose Python-only, and Python fallback supported throughout 4.x with removal not before 5.0.0.
- Preserved the 95% RC measured-coverage target; 85.63% measured coverage remains the sole readiness blocker.

### 3.3.1 — Risk-weighted Python coverage uplift (completed)

- Enabled branch measurement and added a machine-readable coverage-debt report without introducing a separate branch gate.
- Added deterministic failure and boundary tests for Browser, OCR/media, edge inference, Skills, Automation, files, launchers, DeepSeek networking, A2A, and Agent run persistence.
- Raised measured coverage to a conservative 90.52% across two consecutive full runs and the Python CI/preflight/release-manifest gate from 85% to 90%.
- Preserved the 95% RC measured target, approved hybrid architecture contract, Python-only default deployment, and four default-disabled Rust delegates.

### 3.3.2 — 95% coverage and RC readiness rehearsal (completed)

- Added high-value failure coverage for DeepSeek streaming/retry/cache behavior, RAG and file corruption/atomic writes, launcher credentials, agent cancellation/concurrency/persistence, Skills security/versioning, Browser/OCR/media, MCP, and workspace persistence.
- Measured 95.3428% and 95.3396% across two consecutive full runs, reduced HIGH-risk debt, preserved coverage omit rules, and raised the Python gate from 90% to 95%.
- Cleared strict 4.0 RC readiness while preserving ADR-0040, Python-only defaults, four opt-in Rust delegates, and Python fallback through 4.x.
- Did not create an RC tag; version bump, evidence freeze, checksum, tag, and release notes remain a separate change.

### 3.4.0 — Rust semantic-cache vector ranking (completed)

- Added a pure Rust vector-ranking primitive and sidecar endpoint with stable first-match tie behavior.
- Integrated semantic-cache ranking behind the existing default-disabled `DEEPSEEK_RUST_RAG` flag.
- Kept cache storage, filtering, TTL, exact matches, thresholds, and mutation in Python.
- Added strict response validation, backend diagnostics, endpoint smoke coverage, and Python fallback tests.

## Sign-off questions for 4.0.0

Before scheduling 4.0.0, the following should be answered with evidence:

- [x] Which Rust components are default-on, and which remain opt-in? ADR-0040 approves an empty default-on set.
- [x] Is Python coverage at or near 95%? Two consecutive full suites exceeded 95.30%.
- [ ] Is Rust coverage measured and at or near 95%?
- [x] Does the default release deployment include and coordinate the Rust sidecar by design? ADR-0040 explicitly approves Python-only default deployment.
- [x] Are there end-to-end hybrid smoke tests with all flags enabled?
- [ ] Is Rust Policy parity proven against Python Tool Policy?
- [x] Is deterministic Rust RAG hot-path parity proven against Python RAG?
- [ ] Are embedding, vector database, and performance parity proven?
- [x] Does streaming Gateway use Rust or stay on Python by design? It stays on Python for 4.0.
- [x] Does MCP execute real tools in Rust or Python by design? Python Tool Runtime executes them; Rust validates and routes JSON-RPC.

Architecture and Python coverage questions are now answered. The repository is ready to prepare an RC in a separate, evidence-freezing release change.
